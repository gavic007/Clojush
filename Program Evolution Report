Csci 4553: Evolve a program
Markdown Report

For our proble we chose Make Chocolate which is a logic puzzle drawn from the intermediate logic section on the website codingbat.com.
http://codingbat.com/prob/p191363

"We want make a package of goal kilos of chocolate. We have small bars (1 kilo each) and big 
bars (5 kilos each). Return the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars 
before small bars. Return -1 if it can't be done."

makeChocolate(4, 1, 9) → 4
makeChocolate(4, 1, 10) → -1
makeChocolate(4, 1, 7) → 2

This problem was chosen because it shares a few properties with the example problem
“squirrel play”, as they are both from the logic sections of codingbat.  We also 
chose this problem because it has simple logic but would be more difficult to solve 
than “squirrel play” according to the difficulty ratings on codingBat (224.0 vs. 109.0). 
We wanted to see if we could push the program evolution framework to solve a slightly harder problem.
